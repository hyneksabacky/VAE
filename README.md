## Introduction

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that can learn to produce new data samples similar to the input data. In this project, we focus on using VAEs to generate synthetic accelerometer data, which can be valuable for various research and development purposes.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the VAE model and generate synthetic data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. Generate synthetic data using the trained model:
    ```bash
    python generate.py
    ```

## Examples

Here are some examples of synthetic accelerometer data generated by our VAE model:
